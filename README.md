A tiny personal Fabric mod for modern Minecraft.

This mod does not have a theme, it's just a collection of small QOL things i couldn't find another mod for. Mostly for
me, maybe for friends too.

## Features

- Simple ingame web radio
- Prefix for SmashMC-players on other servers
- Glow effect for reported players

## Build & Run

Use the included Gradle wrapper:

```bash
./gradlew runClient
